# logistic_map

I'm making a logistic map influence by veritasrium video
and this is my first graphing program.

The first file is a program that graph and shows times vs population of the logistic map

The second file is a program that graph and shows growth rate vs population of the logistic map

The third file is a program that graph and shows times vs population of the logistic map and graph and shows growth rate vs population of the logistic map side by side (or stacked).
