# logistic_map

I'm making a logistic map influence by veritasrium video
and this is my first graphing program

First file: program that graph and shows times vs population of the logistic map

Second file: program that graph and shows growth rate vs population of the logistic map


Third file: program that graph and shows times vs population of the logistic map and graph and shows growth rate vs population of the logistic map side by side (or stacked)
